Developer Notes
- This project is divided into two layers, Functions(Backend), src(Frontend)
- Frontend:
    - Contains a directory `pages/` which supports the different UI's the user will see. Right now there's only `login` and `signup`. 
    - These grab data from the backend through API calls: GET, POST, etc... 
- Backend:
    - The backend is comprised of API's. This route allows the application to be more modular, and therefore decoupled from the frontend. 
    - Firebase uses a realtime db which is similar to NOSQL. That means schemas unnecessary since data is stored in a hierarchical format.
    - Find more info about the db here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore
    - `API`: Any data that needs to be accessed on the frontend can be done so through these guys. 
        - `goals.js`: Goals API calls 
        - `users.js`: User API calls
